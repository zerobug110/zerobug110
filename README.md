 <summary><h4>üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª Muhammed's Coding Journey</h4></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - And all this while, teaching myself web development with a dream to build my own app, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in programming. A desire that landed me a full-stack software engineering job upon graduation. During my time working as a full-stack developer i also work as a data statistician part time remotely for a sports company based in the Uk. Now i am more focusing on building scalable, high performance and maintainable applications.
